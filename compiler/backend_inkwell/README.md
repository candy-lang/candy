# Candy Inkwell Compiler

This crate provides an LLVM-based backend for the Candy compiler using the inkwell crate.
It is highly experimental and still doesn't support many of Candy's features.

## Requirements

You currently need to have LLVM 15 installed on your system.
You also need to have the `llc` and `clang` commands available.
